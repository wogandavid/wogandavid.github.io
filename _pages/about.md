I am an energy economist and currently reside in Tokyo, Japan. 

I have been practicing energy econmics and modeling for over 10 years. My research interests are on the role of subsidies and quotas on energy system planning and investment. I have regional expertise and insight into countries in the Arabian Peninsula (particularly Saudi Arabia) and Asia-Pacific.

My modeling expertise is in optimzation and mixed-complementarity problems (equilibrium) formulations. I am learning machine learning applied to energy demand estimation.

Concurrently, I am a PhD student at Universite Paris Nanterre in the Energy Economics program, as part of the EconomiX laboratory.
